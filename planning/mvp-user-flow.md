# MVP User Flow: AI Email Agent for Landlords

## Core Value Proposition
**"Add your property, get a magic email address, and AI handles all tenant inquiries for you."**

---

## Simplified User Journey (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Property Setup (30 seconds)
**Goal**: Get landlord from sign-up to magic email address instantly

**User Actions**:
1. Sign up with email/password
2. Add property address
3. Get unique AI email address: `property-123-main-st@tenantai.com`

**Value Delivered**: 
- "Here's your magic email address"
- "Give this to Zillow, Craigslist, anywhere you list your property"
- "AI will handle all responses automatically"

**UI Focus**: 
- Giant "Copy Email Address" button
- Clear instructions: "Share this email on your property listings"
- One-click email template to send to listing sites

---

### Step 2: AI Handles Inquiries (Automatic)
**Goal**: AI processes all incoming emails without landlord intervention

**What Happens**:
1. Tenant emails the AI address with inquiry
2. AI analyzes email content and property details
3. AI generates appropriate response (scheduling, questions, screening)
4. Response queued for landlord approval

**Value Delivered**:
- Landlord gets notification: "AI drafted a response to John Doe"
- Zero effort required from landlord until approval needed

---

### Step 3: Human Approval Loop (2 minutes per response)
**Goal**: Quick review and approval of AI responses

**User Actions**:
1. Open conversation thread
2. See tenant's original message
3. Review AI's draft response
4. Either:
   - Click "Send" (approve as-is)
   - Edit response and click "Send"
   - Click "Skip" (don't respond)

**Value Delivered**:
- Stay in control while saving 90% of time
- Professional responses even when busy
- Never miss an inquiry again
