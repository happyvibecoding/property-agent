# AI Email Pro - Simplified Property Management

## Overview
This is a radically simplified property management app focused ONLY on the AI email workflow. Built for rapid development (2-3 days) with crystal clear user experience.

## App Structure

### Authentication (/(auth)/)
- **Signup**: `/signup` - Dead simple: email, password, first property address
- **Login**: `/login` - Just email/password (no remember me, no complexity)

### Main App (/dashboard/)
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - Combined property list + active conversations
- **Conversation View**: `/conversation/[id]` - 3-panel layout for email management

## Key Features

### 1. Magic Email Copy ✨
- Each property gets a unique AI email (e.g., property-123main@airent.com)
- Copying the email triggers sparkle animation
- Shows "✨ Your AI assistant is ready!" message
- Located in `/components/magic-email-copy.tsx`

### 2. Simplified Dashboard
- Properties displayed as cards with AI email prominently featured
- Active conversations listed with AI draft indicators
- Big "Add Property" button for empty states
- No complex navigation or stats

### 3. AI-Powered Conversation View
- **Left**: Message thread (clean email-style layout)
- **Right**: AI response panel with:
  - Suggested response with confidence score
  - Edit/Regenerate/Send controls
  - Tone analysis
  - AI insights about the inquiry

### 4. Clean Components
- **PropertyCard**: Shows property + magic email with sparkle copy
- **MessageThread**: Simple email-style message display
- **AIResponsePanel**: Full AI response interface
- **MagicEmailCopy**: Sparkle animation component
